# mkrskr-test

## Development

To run the application you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine.

Run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

It will build each service `development.Dockerfile` and expose the frontend application on: `http://localhost:4000`
